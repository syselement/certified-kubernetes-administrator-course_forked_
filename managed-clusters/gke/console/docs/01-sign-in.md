# Provision lab

Last updated: June 2024

Since this is a Google product, it will work best in Chrome browser. Other mainstream browsers *should* be fine.

### IMPORTANT

Note that if you are already signed into your browser with a Google account, it may try to use that and you will get an error and/or sign yourself out of your Google account. If you already have a personal GCP account and you are signed into Google, then it *will use this automatically* and not connect you to the playground! If either of these apply to you, then use an incognito window to sign into the playground account.

### Provision your GCP playground lab

Prerequisite: Premium KodeKloud subscription

Access this link: https://kodekloud.com/playgrounds/playground-google-cloud and click `START LAB` to request a new GCP Playground instance. After a few seconds, you will receive your temporary GCP portal account like this:

Copy the **Console Link** by pressing the copy button to the right of it, paste to your browser and sign in with the given credentials. Provide the username given for the lab as `email or phone` in the sign-in dialog.

In the dialog box that follows, select your country and agree to terms of service. Leave **Email updates** unchecked.
