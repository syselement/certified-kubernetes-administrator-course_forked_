# GKE with Terraform

Last updated: March 2025

In this guide, we will deploy a GKE cluster which is compliant with the KodeKloud playground security and usage policies using terraform from within Cloud Shell. Running Cloud Shell from within the GCP console has the advantage that all the authentication and project details are already set in the environment.

Since this is a Google product, it will work best in Chrome browser. Other mainstream browsers *should* be fine.
